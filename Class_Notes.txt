star schema:when all dimensions are connected to one fact table. 

snowflake schema: when all dimensions are not directly connected to fact table.
ex:when there is sub category under category and that is not diretly connected to fact table.

--it is a weak schema compared to star schema.

1.get the data of factinternatsales, dimcustomer, dimgeography.
2.Building relationshp between fact and dimensions.


Joins:
In power bi we call it as merge-

1.merge query:it will combine two tables
2.merge query as new:it will combine two tables and transform it to new table.

left outer:left table +matching records
right outer:right+matching records
left anti:non matching records from left table(it is like except)

--append 
it works when u have same no of columns in both tables with same column names.

visualization:scatter plot, waterfall chart, pie chart.

differnece betweeen dashboard and report?
dashboard is like readable format where we choose the multiple visuals from different reports.
-dashboard is something like where we show it to the enduser.
-


Report is like powerbi desktop where we can edit.

--powerbi service:
1.creating workspace

2.creating dahsboard.

3.understanding lineage
--datasource-->dataset--->report--->dashboard

4.NLP inside dashbaord

5.Quick insights--we can generate it for once.

--we can also pin the visuals to the dashbaord.

-liscences:

power bi pro:10 $ per user per month

--it is used for publishing 

power bi premium:it is used for large organiations.
1.per user:20$
2.per capacity:4995$ per capacity


In order to reduce the cost we publish in apps section.

DAX:
Measures and calculated columns:

aggregate functions:
SUM:
SUMX:iterative functions
Some other iterative function like countx,maxx,averagex,minx,


DAX:
profitable or not 2 = IF(Orders[Profit]>100, "Very much profit", 
 IF(AND(Orders[Profit]>=50,Orders[Profit]<=100), "somewhat profitable",
 "not so profitable"))


Variables:
profit% var = 
var profit=SUM(Orders[Profit])
var sales=SUM(Orders[Sales])
return
profit/sales


if function
switch function
calcuate-used to filter out aggregate value
profit %

DAX:
Time intellignece functions:

last year sales=calculate(sum(orders[sales]),sameperiodlastyear(dimdate[date]))
previous year sales pp = CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[Sales]),PARALLELPERIOD(Dimdate[Date],-1,QUARTER))


connecting direct query:

Data Gateways:
1.personal mode:
-->only i can access the data.
-->Managing your Gateway becomes difficult(sharing and collaboration will be difficult)

2.Standard mode:(Recommended)
--working with team

steps to set up gateway:
step1:email id
step2:enter the recovery key.

Row-level security: we give different permissions to different people based on access.

Note: we will define the roles in deskotop level and publish to power bi service and Access wil  be given on power bi service.

Applying manage parameters

create pbit file to filter the data based on region by using parameters

Deployment:


There is another tool called Power bi desktop rs where we can publish the report to the power bi servise as well as on-prem-server(pbi report server)


Installing power bi desktop report server  and configuring.
